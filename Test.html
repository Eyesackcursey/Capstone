        Our project is on a new device known as EzGPS, which is a HUD projection device for your car. It will use reflective lens technology in order to display the screen while the device sits on the dashboard of your car. It will connect to your smartphone and run on a supported android app and be powered by the cigarette lighter port in your car. From your phone, you will be able to enter an address and it will load it into the device and display directions, with no need to keep looking down at your phone. This is important because there is no device like this that is commonly used. This device can reduce risk of distractions during driving, to keep you more safe. It also makes traveling in your car more practical and easy. There is a large amount of potential for this device. We are just starting out with a GPS functionality, but it can later be updated to do almost anything else you can do with your smartphone while driving. Some later features that could be added could be calling or texting, google searches, or selecting music to play in your car. Voice activation and commands can also later be implemented to make the device even more hands free. But for now input methods will be through a connected device, but overall, has a large opportunity for improvement and expansion. The main challenge in this project is designing the physical device as well as developing the software. It gets complicated when trying to implement google maps API with our Android software, as well as factors like our special filter for the software in order for the software to not obstruct the view of the driver while driving. Our main approach was to take it one step at a time, and break up the project into pieces. We first started at the drawing board, see figure 1, and drew out what we wanted the device to look like. Then our programmer begin developing software while the other group members kept up with documentation and acquiring a physical projector to play around with and test with the software. So far our approach has been successful and we plan to continue this way in the spring.
